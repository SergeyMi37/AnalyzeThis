# AnalyzeThis
Easily transform a CSV file into a personalized preview of DeepSee

## Accessing
Once <a href="#installing">installation</a> is complete, a new "Analyze This" Link will be added to the User Portal. The User Portal can be found from the Management Portal -> Analytics -> User Portal

## Using
Provide a CSV file and assign dimensions/measures as necessary. Once ready, click the import button. At this point, a Cach√© class is created based on the CSV file and the data is imported. This new class is used as the source for the DeepSee cube. A DeepSee cube is also generated based on the properties in the source class. Once the cube is created and the records are built, a sample dashboard can be viewed. A scoring system is used to evaluate and rank the possible charts and tables that are displayed on this dashboard. After getting a visual idea of what DeepSee can offer, users can begin exploring the model within Architect or the data within Analyzer.
